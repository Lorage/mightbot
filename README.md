# MightBot
A simple Twitch chatbot written in Go.

#### Requires these environment variables
```bash
export CHANNEL_NAME="[your channel name]"
export BOT_ACCOUNT_NAME="[your bot account name]"
export BOT_OAUTH_TOKEN="[your bot OAuth token]"
```

## TODO
1. Make sure there is no channel spam from the bot
2. Move from a JSON file based system to a simple GUI
